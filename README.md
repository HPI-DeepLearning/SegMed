This repository contains the code to solve the [Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2017](http://braintumorsegmentation.org/) as part of the seminar "Practical Video Analysis" during the summer term 2017 at Hasso Plattner Institute for Software Systems Engineering. Most of the model is based on [pix2pix-tensorflow](https://github.com/yenchenlin/pix2pix-tensorflow).
