# SegMed
This repository contains the code to solve the [Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2017](http://braintumorsegmentation.org/) as part of the seminar "Practical Video Analysis" during the summer term 2017 at Hasso Plattner Institute for Software Systems Engineering. Most of the model is based on [pix2pix-tensorflow](https://github.com/yenchenlin/pix2pix-tensorflow).

- BRATS related tasks
    - The segmentation can be found inside the pix2pix-ultimate folder.
    - The classification can be found inside the classification folder.
    - The survival rate prediction can be found inside the survival_rate folder.
- The introduction tasks can be found inside the brain_health_classification folder
# Demo
The demo code is located in the server subdirectory. It requieres a trained segmentation model.
