# Experiments section

This folder contains some a collection of investigation files. For visualization
purposes we used Jupyter notebooks. These are the most interesting parts of our work
because they mostly contain the currently tested Keras model, some execution results
and notes on our methods we tried out.

You can find some of our results at survival_rate/analysis.
